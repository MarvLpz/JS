web components
set of web platform apis that allow us to create custom, reusable and encapsulated html tags to use in web pages and web apps

An important aspect of web components is encapsulation â€” being able to keep the markup structure, style, and behavior hidden and 
separate from other code on the page so that different parts do not clash, and the code can be kept nice and clean.

custom elements
shadow DOM - separates inside style to outside style?
    The ShadowRoot interface of the Shadow DOM API is the root node of a DOM subtree that is rendered separately from a document's main DOM tree
html templates - HTML element is a mechanism for holding HTML that is not to be rendered immediately when a 
    page is loaded but may be instantiated subsequently during runtime using JavaScript


Custom Elements lifecycle method, rendered by extend HTMLElement
constructor
connectedcallback
disconnectedcallback
attributechangedcallback

PROBLEM
cors policy blocking local folder run when using export js. installed live server extension in VSCODE to run code in localhost server


next steps
DEEP dive in lifecycle method,
constructor? super?
